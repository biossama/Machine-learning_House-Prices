# House Prices Analysis and Prediction üè†

This project analyzes house price data to perform exploratory analysis and build a predictive model using machine learning techniques. It combines data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Analyze the relationships** between various house features and their sale prices.
2. **Build a predictive model** to estimate the sale price of a house based on its features.

The key steps include:
- Loading and exploring the data.
- Preprocessing the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical data).
- Correlation analysis and visualization.
- Building machine learning models to predict house prices.

Data

The data used in this project is sourced from the file train.csv. Each row represents a house, and each column corresponds to a specific feature (e.g., living area size, construction quality, number of rooms, etc.).

Key Columns:

    SalePrice: Sale price (target variable).
    OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
    GrLivArea: Total living area in square feet.
    Other categorical and numerical features.
